                        Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed; and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit.  No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one. My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.   And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow.  The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound.  And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are perfum'd with civet.</p>
                     <p>
                        It is meat and drink to me to see a clown:  The better part of valour is discretion. But this denoted a foregone conclusion:  Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me.  But whate'er you are That in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of melancholy boughs, Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time; If ever you have look'd on better days, If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church, If ever sat at any good man's feast, If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear, And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied, Let gentleness my strong enforcement be; In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
                    </p>                   
                    <h3>It beggared all description.</h3>

                    <p>It beggared all description.  Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.  If he fail of that, He will have other means to cut you off; I overheard him and his practices.   But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree That cannot so much as a blossom yield In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.   Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.   Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this, That your poor friends must woo your company?  What, you look merrily! I must have liberty Withal, as large a charter as the wind, To blow on whom I please, for so fools have; And they that are most galled with my folly, They most must laugh.  Not see him since! Sir, sir, that cannot be.</p>
                     <p>I have not slept one wink.  Harp not on that. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st, charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there begins my sadness.  Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me.  And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to  whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.  But whate'er you are That in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of melancholy boughs, Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time; If ever you have look'd on better days, If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church, If ever sat at any good man's feast, If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear, And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied, Let gentleness my strong enforcement be; In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life.  You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge.</p>

                    <p>Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but that they call compliment is like th' encounter of two dog-apes; and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks.  The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound.

                    <p>Brevity is the soul of wit.  And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to  whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.  And then he drew a dial from his poke, And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye, Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock; Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags; 'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine; And after one hour more 'twill be eleven; And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe, And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot; And thereby hangs a tale.'  Why, who cries out on pride That can therein tax any private party?  Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea, Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?  What woman in the city do I name When that I say the city-woman bears The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?  Who can come in and say that I mean her, When such a one as she such is her neighbour?  Or what is he of basest function That says his bravery is not on my cost, Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits His folly to the mettle of my speech?  There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right, Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free, Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies, Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?</p>
                    <p>that's neither here nor there.  More, more, I prithee, more. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues. I must have liberty Withal, as large a charter as the wind, To blow on whom I please, for so fools have; And they that are most galled with my folly, They most must laugh.  Why, who cries out on pride That can therein tax any private party?  Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea, Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?  What woman in the city do I name When that I say the city-woman bears The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?

Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.</p>

This is no place; this house is but a butchery; Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more. And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lin'd, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part.
